# Chat session: 247Sports scraper work — 2025-10-07

Summary

This document captures the actions taken during the chat session on 2025-10-07 to create a Playwright-based scraper for 247Sports and to gather recruit ranking CSVs for 2019–2024.

What I did

- Diagnosed an initial failure when running `python {active_document}` due to `python` not being on PATH; used `python3`.
- Created a simple requests+BeautifulSoup scraper (initial approach) in `/Users/mattcohen/recruit_scrape_2019.py` but the site blocked direct requests (HTTP 403).
- Installed Playwright and downloaded Chromium browser binaries.
- Implemented a Playwright-based scraper `recruit_scrape_2019_playwright.py` to render pages and parse the DOM with BeautifulSoup.
- Iteratively updated parsing to match the rendered DOM (rank, name, position, metrics, school/state, stars, commitment).
- Successfully produced CSVs for years 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024.

Files added to repo `data/247sports/`

- `recruit_scrape_2019_playwright.py` — Playwright scraper script.
- `README.md` — Instructions and dependencies for running the scraper.
- `recruit_rankings_2019.csv` through `recruit_rankings_2024.csv` — Scraped CSVs for each year.
- `chat-scrape-session-2025-10-07.md` — This transcript summary.

How to run the scraper locally

1. Install dependencies (Python 3.8+):

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user playwright beautifulsoup4 pandas requests
# install browsers for playwright (one-time):
/Users/mattcohen/Library/Python/3.13/bin/playwright install chromium
```

2. Run a scraper for a single year (example):

```bash
python3 data/247sports/recruit_scrape_2019_playwright.py
```

Notes and next steps

- The Playwright-based scraper is more reliable for JS-rendered pages. Rate-limit and respect Terms of Service for regular scraping.
- If you want to scrape multiple years in one run, I can add CLI support (accept list of URLs or a file) and optional rate-limiting/delay.
- If you'd like the raw chat text saved instead of this summary, I can add that too (but it may include sensitive tokens if present; none were used here).

Commit history (high-level)

- Added Playwright scraper and CSVs for 2019–2024.

Ask to continue scraping additional years, implement the multi-URL runner, or add automation (GitHub Actions) to run on a schedule.
